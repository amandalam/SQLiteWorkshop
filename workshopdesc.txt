Waiting too long for Excel's VLOOKUP? Use SQLite for simple data analysis!

Excel formulas can be quite slow when you're processing data files with thousands of rows. It's also especially difficult to maintain the files when you have some messy mixture of VLOOKUPs, Pivot Tables, Macros and VBAs. 

In this interactive workshop targeted for non-coders, we will make use of SQLite, a very lightweight and portable open source database library, to perform some simple and repeatable data analysis on large datasets that are publicly available. We will also explore what you can further do with the data by using some powerful extensions of SQLite.

While SQLite may not totally replace Excel in many ways, after the workshop you will find that it can improve your work efficiency and make your life much easier in so many use cases!

Who should attend this workshop?
- If you're frustrated with the slow performance of Excel formulas when dealing with large datasets in your daily work
- No coding experience is required

Requirements
- Bring your own laptop (it can be Windows, Mac or Linux)


Instead of giving a talk, I propose to frame this as a workshop where participants will bring their own laptops and be guided to to install DB Browser for SQLite, download a publicly available large data set, and write some simple SQL statements to analyse the data. 

The participants will also have chances to try out some powerful extensions of SQLite to perform more complex data analysis (e.g. calculating correlations), full text search and text similarity comparisons.

All the SQLite SQL scripts, slides and the extensions (source & binaries) will be uploaded to my Github and Slideshare for participants' easy reference.
